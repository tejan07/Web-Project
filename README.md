This is my first attempt to create a website along with the server side scripting.This was also a part of my subject web programming in 7th semester.The project can be run/emulated in xampp server.It is comprised of the following languages-php,javascript(for events and validating user login using regular expression),html and css.The backend uses the mysql database in phpmyadmin of xampp.It also uses cookies at the login page.The homepage of the project is page.php file.The website is a collection of songs to listen to every mood.
